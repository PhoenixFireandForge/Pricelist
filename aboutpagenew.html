    <h1>üî• About Phoenix Fire and Forge</h1>

    <h2>üî® Meet the Blacksmith ‚Äî Matthew Seitz</h2>
    <p>My name is Matthew Seitz, and I‚Äôm the owner and blacksmith behind Phoenix Fire and Forge, located in Yellow Grass, Saskatchewan.</p>
    <p>Blacksmithing first sparked my interest as a kid, though I never had the chance to try it back then. Years later, after moving to my current home, a neighbor and I were talking when he mentioned he had an old, broken-down forge sitting in a scrap pile. I hauled it out, rebuilt it, and fired it up ‚Äî and the rest is history. What began as a curiosity turned into a passion, and now I work from a custom-built propane forge that runs far more efficiently than that first beat-up relic.</p>
    <p>I‚Äôve been blacksmithing for over 12 years, mostly self-taught through trial, error, and a lot of YouTube. I‚Äôve had the help of a few local folks who offered advice, but my craft has largely been shaped by persistence and passion.</p>
    <p>What do I love most about blacksmithing? The heat. There‚Äôs something about the intense temperature and raw energy of the forge that makes me feel superhuman ‚Äî like I‚Äôm tapping into something ancient and powerful.</p>
    <p>Outside the forge, I enjoy welding on a small scale and smoking meat on my homemade offset smoker. Creativity, craftsmanship, and fire seem to follow me no matter what I‚Äôm doing.</p>

    <h2>üî• About the Forge</h2>
    <p>Phoenix Fire and Forge officially began in 2015 under the name ‚ÄúFire and Forge.‚Äù After too many people confused it with the TV show Forged in Fire, I rebranded with something more personal. The phoenix has always symbolized resilience and rebirth to me ‚Äî the idea that no matter how bad things get, you can always rise from the ashes stronger than before. That belief is at the core of everything I do.</p>
    <p>I specialize in hand-forged practical items for the outdoors and around the home. My most popular products include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Fire pokers</li>
      <li>Campfire drink holders</li>
      <li>Steak flippers</li>
      <li>Bottle openers</li>
      <li>Hot dog roaster stands</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each piece is crafted by hand in my custom-built propane forge. I finish every item with canola oil, and any tool that might touch food is treated with locally-sourced beeswax from a Saskatchewan beekeeper ‚Äî because I believe in keeping things natural, functional, and connected to the community.</p>
    <p>While I focus mostly on useful and practical items, I do accept custom commissions on a limited basis. Please note that custom work is typically more expensive due to the time and precision involved.</p>
    <p>My typical customers include homeowners, outdoorsmen, and anyone who appreciates quality craftsmanship forged by fire.</p>
    <p>I attend as many markets and fairs as possible throughout the spring and summer, and I always enjoy connecting with folks who appreciate the tradition and art of blacksmithing.</p>

    <h2>‚öíÔ∏è Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>My long-term goal for Phoenix Fire and Forge is to pass this craft on to future generations. I believe in the value of working with your hands, building things that last, and keeping this timeless trade alive.</p>
